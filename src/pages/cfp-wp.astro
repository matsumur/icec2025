  <p>Work in Progress (WiP) contributions provide an opportunity to present late-breaking work, new experimental projects, research in early phases or with more limited scope than typical full papers. A WiP submission is a shorter submission describing the research problem, contribution, and value to the community, submitted as a PDF file. Accepted papers will be included into the official <strong>Springer LNCS proceedings</strong> and will be scheduled for presentation and discussion at the conference.</p>

  <h4>Submission Guidelines</h4>
  <p>WiP submissions should not exceed <strong>8 pages</strong> in length, excluding references, in <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="_blank">Springer LNCS format</a>. Submissions with exceeding length relative to their contribution can be rejected. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs.</p>
  <p>All contributions have to be submitted via <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icec20250" target="_blank">EasyChair</a> (anonymized for double-blind review, authors and self-reference articles).</p>
