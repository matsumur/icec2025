<p>The 24th International Federation for Information Processing – International Conference on Entertainment Computing (IFIP ICEC 2025) will be held in Tokyo, Japan, from 27th to 30th August. The conference is organized by the IFIP TC14 Entertainment Computing Technical Committee and hosted by the IPSJ SIG-EC and Nihon University. IFIP ICEC is one of the longest-running, most prestigious scientific conferences in the field of Entertainment Computing, bringing together practitioners, researchers, artists, designers, and industry professionals focused on the creation, development, and application of digital entertainment content and experience systems. It covers a wide range of research areas, including interactive art, game-based learning, XR technologies, and the ethical implications of entertainment.</p>

<h4>Journal Track</h4>
<p>This year, ICEC continues to innovate by offering a journal track submission option. Authors can submit Full Papers to the prestigious Elsevier Entertainment Computing Journal or to the Full Paper conference track. Journal submissions will undergo a double-blind review process and may be accepted either for the journal or the conference track with resubmission, or rejected. Papers accepted for the journal track will follow Elsevier’s editorial process and be published at a later date. We recommend submitting only highly developed and mature works to the journal track.</p>

<h4>Conference Track</h4>
<p>Conference papers will be published in a book form in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Conference track submissions will undergo a double-blind review process and may be accepted either for the conference or the Works in Progress track, or rejected. Authors will be able to have an advantage of a later submission deadline compared with the Journal Track.</p>

<h4>Other Tracks</h4>
<p>ICEC also encourages authors to submit their work to the  Work-in-progress, Workshops and Tutorials, Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works,  Student Game and Interactive Entertainment Competition, and Doctoral Consortium tracks, to explore new topics and foster collaboration among researchers.

    <h4>Calls for Submissions</h4>

    <h4>1. Journal and Conference Tracks</h4>
    <p>
        Full papers are the main media for presenting high impact, mature research with original new results. Submissions 
        should describe novel unpublished work addressing one or more of the research topics listed. As a new feature this 
        year, authors can submit their papers to either the journal track or the conference track.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Journal track will publish accepted papers in a special issue of the Elsevier’s Journal of Entertainment Computing (ENTCOM). 
        Accepted papers will be presented at the conference, and published in the journal at a later date. Papers presented for the 
        journal track should follow the submission and publication process of ENTCOM. Papers submitted to the journal could be either 
        conditionally accepted in the journal track, conditionally accepted after resubmission in the conference track, or rejected. 
        Note that the deadline for the conference track will be after the journal track notification. Papers accepted to this track will 
        be published in the special issue only if at least one author registers and presents their work at the conference.
    </p>
    <p>
        Accepted conference papers will be published in a book form in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Papers 
        submitted to the conference track could be either conditionally accepted in the conference track, conditionally accepted in the Works 
        in Progress track, or rejected. Accepted papers will be scheduled for long presentations and discussions at the conference. Papers 
        accepted to this track will be published in LNCS, only if at least one author registers and presents their work at the conference.
    </p>
    <p>
        Paper length should reflect the contribution and maturity of the submission and reviewers from the program committee will be 
        instructed to judge the contribution of a paper relative to its length. For example, typical contributions presenting significant 
        research advances/results should not exceed 12 pages in length excluding references.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, videos are encouraged and can be included in the paper or as Electronic Supplementary Material. 
        See the guidelines for the journal or the conference track for more details.
    </p>


2 Works in Progress   
Work in Progress (WiP) contributions provide an opportunity to present late-breaking work, new experimental projects, research in early phases or with more limited scope than typical full papers. A WiP submission is a shorter submission describing the research problem, contribution, and value to the community, submitted as a PDF file. Accepted papers will be included into the official Springer LNCS proceedings and will be scheduled for presentation and discussion at the conference.   
WiP submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length, excl. references, in Springer LNCS format. Submissions with exceeding length relative to their contribution can be rejected. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs.

Submissions need to adhere to the stated workshop proposal deadline. Additionally, to be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of
workshop proposals may also submit a 6 page (maximum, excl. references) paper in the Springer LNCS format, observing the deadline for full paper submission.
Regular workshop proposals will not be included in the proceedings.   

3.2 Tutorials   
We invite proposals for tutorials that will be held in conjunction with ICEC 2025. We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing (see conference topics
listed above) and particularly welcome proposals that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends. Tutorial proposals should be two pages in
length and must include the following information: 
– Contact information (name, affiliation, address, phone number and email) of the tutorial organizer(s);   
– Relevant CV information of the tutorial leader(s);   
– Tutorial title;

To be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of tutorial proposals may also submit a 6 page (maximum) paper in the Springer LNCS
format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular tutorial proposals will not be included in the proceedings.

4 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works     
Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works are interactive demonstrations, installations and games that show early implementations of novel, interesting, and important entertainment computing concepts, systems, installations or games, or can serve to showcase results not previously described in the research literature.     

Both research and industry is encouraged to send in and showcase demonstrators of novel approaches to entertainment. We particularly encourage demonstrations with which attendees can interact and play.

An Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works submission is a shorter submission describing a novel approach to entertainment computing concepts. Submissions will be peer-reviewed and should be composed of a document with 4-5 pages using Springer LNCS format, and structured as follows: (1) up to four pages for an extended abstract and (2) a final page that contains the link to an online video, a list of technical requirements (including electrical and connectivity needs), and physical space requirements (including display and footprint needs). Successful submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. Submissions  should follow the underlying extended abstract structure and must be clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. The extended abstract must contain the following sections: abstract and keywords, introduction, methodology, findings, conclusion, and references. Sections can be named differently, and subsections can be included. Supporting figures, tables and images of the results may be included in the extended
abstract. 

By default, demos and games will have a table, chairs and internet connection available. By their nature, interactive installations are intended for larger, potentially public spaces. We will try to accommodate for the needs of these types of  installations, but please include a minimal set-up so that we know the range of requirements that we will need to meet. Successful authors of demonstration/installation submissions will be contacted by the chair to confirm the availability of the requested resources. The abstract, digital video and requirements supplement must be submitted electronically.     

5 Student Game and Interactive Entertainment Competition     
Besides Interactive Entertainment, IFIP-ICEC 2025 also organizes a competition for student games and interactive entertainment. All students up to and including PhD candidate level are eligible to send in their game or interactive entertainment installation, as long as the demonstrator is fully experiential, and the demonstrator is part of a research endeavor. This could be a platform to perform research with, a research through design contribution, or a design exemplar of something that advances the state of the art, but the paper detailing the game or interactive entertainment installation should make clear what the development of it may add to our knowledge of games and entertainment. For PhD candidates, this could be a good venue to have the artifact contribution of your interactive entertainment installation peer-reviewed and published in official proceedings.

Submissions to the game and interactive entertainment competition should be done in a 4-6 page extended abstract in Springer LNCS format, that among others clearly describes the research goal, a description of the experience of the demonstrator with pictures, and how the demonstrator advances the state of the art.     
Submissions furthermore require a video of at least 1:30 minutes that clearly shows the experience of the game or interactive entertainment installation. A download link to the executable in case of a game is highly appreciated. Teamwork is allowed as long as the total amount of work into the game or installation does not exceed 48 person-months.     
At least one of the student authors on the paper needs to register and be physically present at the conference to showcase the game or installation in order to have a chance at winning the competition. A jury of experts is formed at the conference to select the winner, and the winner will be announced at the end of the conference.     
There are two moments to enter the student competition. In order to be eligible for the proceedings, you have to submit your paper by the early submission deadline. If you want to participate in the competition without a conference proceedings paper or on the basis of an accepted full or work-in-progress paper, contact the student competition chairs a week before the start of the conference at the latest.

6 Doctoral Consortium     
The Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished researchers in entertainment computing and/or serious games. We invite students who feel they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work to apply for this unique opportunity to share their work with students in a similar situation as well as senior researchers in the field. The strongest candidates will be those who have a clear idea and an area, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that they can no longer make changes. Also, as well as stating how you will gain from acceptance, both you and your advisor should be clear on what you can contribute to the Doctoral Consortium.     
The Consortium will provide a supportive setting for feedback on students’ current research and guidance on future research directions. It will also offer each student comments and fresh perspectives on their work from researchers and students outside their own institution and promote the development of a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research. Current graduate students pursuing a PhD project who would benefit from detailed workshop discussions of their doctoral research should submit a single PDF file consisting of a 4-page extended abstract of your thesis work in Springer LNCS format, clearly specifying the originality of the work with respect to current concepts and techniques, the importance of the work with respect to fundamental issues and themes in entertainment computing, results to date and their validity and contribution of the work (expected and/or achieved) to entertainment computing and/or serious games. Candidates must also send a biographical note, the sponsor or project grant name (if applicable), and affiliation, as well as a one-paragraph statement of expected benefits of participation for both yourself and the other consortium participants (i.e., what will you contribute as well as gain).
