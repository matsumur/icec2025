<h2>Calls for Submissions</h2>

    <h4>1. Journal and Conference Tracks</h4>
    <p>
        Full papers are the main media for presenting high impact, mature research with original new results. Submissions 
        should describe novel unpublished work addressing one or more of the research topics listed. As a new feature this 
        year, authors can submit their papers to either the journal track or the conference track.
    </p>
    <h5 id="journal">1.1 Journal Track</h5>
    <p>This year, ICEC offers a journal track submission option. Authors may submit Full Papers to Entertainment Computing or the Full Paper conference track. Journal submissions will undergo a double-blind review and may be accepted, accepted with resubmission to the conference track, or rejected. We recommend submitting only highly developed works to the journal track.
    <p>The Journal track will publish accepted papers in a special issue of Elsevier’s Journal of Entertainment Computing (ENTCOM). Papers will be presented at the conference and published in the journal later, following ENTCOM’s submission and publication process. Submissions may be conditionally accepted in the journal track, conditionally accepted in the conference track after resubmission, or rejected. The conference track deadline will be after the journal track notification. At least one author must register and present at the conference for inclusion in the special issue. Videos are encouraged and can be included in the paper or as supplementary material.</p>
    <p>Please read the <a href="https://icec2025.entcomp.org/cfp-journal/">Guideline for the Journal Track page</a> for more information.</p>

    <h5 id="conf">1.2 Conference Track</h5>
    <p>Conference papers will be published in a book form in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Conference track submissions will undergo a double-blind review process and may be accepted either for the conference or the Works in Progress track, or rejected. Authors will be able to have an advantage of a later submission deadline compared with the Journal Track.</p>
    <p>Accepted papers will be scheduled for long presentations and discussions at the conference. Papers accepted to this track will be published in LNCS, only if at least one author registers and presents their work at the conference.</p>
    <p>Paper length should reflect the contribution and maturity of the submission and reviewers from the program committee will be instructed to judge the contribution of a paper relative to its length. For example, typical contributions presenting significant research advances/results should not exceed 12 pages in length excluding references.</p>
    <p>Please read the <a href="https://icec2025.entcomp.org/cfp-conference/">Call for Conference Track page</a> for more information.</p>
    

    <h4 id="wp">2 Works in Progress</h4>
    <p>
        Work in Progress (WiP) contributions provide an opportunity to present late-breaking work, new experimental projects, 
        research in early phases or with more limited scope than typical full papers. A WiP submission is a shorter submission 
        describing the research problem, contribution, and value to the community, submitted as a PDF file. Accepted papers will 
        be included into the official Springer LNCS proceedings and will be scheduled for presentation and discussion at the conference.
    </p>
    <p>
        WiP submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length, excluding references, in Springer LNCS format. Submissions with 
        exceeding length relative to their contribution can be rejected. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or 
        route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs.
    </p>
    <p>Please read the <a href="https://icec2025.entcomp.org/cfp-wp/">Call for Work-in-Progress page</a> for more information.</p>

        will not be included in the proceedings.
    </p>

    <h4 id="ie">4 Interactive Entertainment Showcase</h4>
    <p>
        Interactive Entertainment Showcase are interactive demonstrations, installations, and games that show early 
        implementations of novel, interesting, and important entertainment computing concepts, systems, installations, or games, or 
        can serve to showcase results not previously described in the research literature.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both research and industry are encouraged to send in and showcase demonstrators of novel approaches to entertainment. We 
        particularly encourage demonstrations with which attendees can interact and play.
    </p>
    <p>
        An Interactive Entertainment Showcase submission is a shorter submission describing a novel approach to 
        entertainment computing concepts. Submissions will be peer-reviewed and should be composed of a document with 4-5 pages using 
        Springer LNCS format, and structured as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Up to four pages for an extended abstract</li>
        <li>A final page that contains the link to an online video, a list of technical requirements (including electrical and connectivity needs), and physical space requirements (including display and footprint needs)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Successful submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. Submissions should follow the underlying extended 
        abstract structure and must be clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. The extended abstract must contain the following sections: 
        abstract and keywords, introduction, methodology, findings, conclusion, and references. Sections can be named differently, and subsections can be included.
    </p>

    <p>Please read the <a href="https://icec2025.entcomp.org/cfp-ie/">Call for Interactive Entertainment Showcase Track page</a> for more information.</p>
    

    <h4 id="sc">5 Student Competition</h4>
    <p>All students up to and including PhD candidate level are eligible to send in their game or interactive entertainment installation, as long as the demonstrator is fully experiential, and the demonstrator is part of a research endeavor. This could be a platform to perform research with, a research through design contribution, or a design exemplar of something that advances the state of the art, but the paper detailing the game or interactive entertainment installation should make clear what the development of it may add to our knowledge of games and entertainment.</p>
    <p>Please read the <a href="https://icec2025.entcomp.org/cfp-sc/">Call for Student Competition page</a> for more information.</p>

    <h4 id="dc">6 Doctoral Consortium</h4>
    <p>The Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished researchers in entertainment computing and/or serious games. We invite students who feel they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work to apply for this unique opportunity to share their work with students in a similar situation as well as senior researchers in the field. The strongest candidates will be those who have a clear idea and an area, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that they can no longer make changes. Also, as well as stating how you will gain from acceptance, both you and your advisor should be clear on what you can contribute to the Doctoral Consortium.</p>
    <p>Please read the <a href="https://icec2025.entcomp.org/cfp-dc/">Call for Doctoral Consortium page</a> for more information.</p>


    <!-- <h4>Other Tracks</h4>
    <p>ICEC also encourages authors to submit their work to the Work-in-progress, Workshops and Tutorials, and Doctoral Consortium tracks, to explore new topics and foster collaboration among researchers.</p>
